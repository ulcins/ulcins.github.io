            <h1>Update</h1>
            <p>It's been a few months since I wrote something so: As always, I was bored, and decided to update the website :D</p>
            <p>Added:</p>
            <li>
                <p>A header, containing home (my blogs), about me, and the equipment I currently use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Auto dark/light mode</p>
            </li>
            <p>I haven't really written any blogs (been mostly busy, but also lazy if I am being honest haha), but I do have an idea for the next blog, it will be related to the hisense touch again :)
            <p>Have a great day!</p>
