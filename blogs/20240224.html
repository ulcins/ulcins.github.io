    <h1>2024-02-24 // hisense touch lite review</h1>
    <h2>[note]</h2>
    1. this is my first ever review & e-reader, english is not my first language, but hopefully i have written everything clearly <br />
    2. i have used the e-reader for 3 weeks
    <h2>[difference between touch and touch lite]</h2>
    <p>there are 3 differences between the hisense touch and touch lite:</p>
    <p>1. no hifi/dac - if you have iems or wired high quality ear/headphones, and you are planning to use the device as a music player, i would recommend getting the hisense touch instead<br />
    as the hisense touch lite doesn't have a dac. <br />
    2. no front camera - i guess the main purpose of the front camera is for face unlock? i personally do not care about the face unlock<br />
    3. storage - the hisense touch base model has 128gb, whereas the hisense touch lite has 64gb, however, there is a 128gb option for the hisense touch lite (i have the 128gb model)<br />
    </p>
    <h2>[unboxing]</h2>
    <p>in the box, you get:</p>
    <li>the e-reader itself</li>
    <li>a usb-a to usb-c charging cable</li>
    <li>some papers/manuals (that you likely can't read because it's in chinese)</li>
    <h2>[design]</h2>
    <p>the hisense touch lite has a flat design & made from aluminum, if you own a iphone 12 & above (or used a iphone 4/4s/5/5s/se 1st gen), then you will get the idea of how the e-reader feels like <br />
    it is also lightweight, weighing at 155g, making the e-reader very comfortable to hold. <br />
    the screen is great, it's 5.9", very responsive, there are 4 modes for responsiveness: <br />
    <li>clear (slow, best for reading)</li> 
    <li>balanced (fast)</li>
    <li>smooth (faster)</li>
    <li>speed (fastest)</li> <br />

    <a href="https://ibb.co/hR3DCMG">side by side comparasion</a>
    <br /> 
    i give the design a 9/10, 1 complaint is that, because the back is made out of aluminum, it is easy to scratch it.
    </p>
    <h2>[battery life]</h2>
    <p>the battery life is great, it comes with a 3000mAh battery, i charge it once a week, my screen time is 2-3h a day, and i have to charge it weekly, so usually every Sunday <br />
    <br />
    battery is just 10/10, i only worry about it on weekends.
    </p>
    <h2>[software]</h2>
    <p>the hisense touch comes installed with android 11, with a skin of touch os 1.0, which is a black and white skin, made for e-ink <br />
    it does have chinese bloatware, however, most of it can be easily uninstalled. depending from which seller you buy it from (i bought mine from aliexpress, the chosen ereader store, recommended seller) <br />
    mine came with google play, i do not care about google play, most of my apps are from f-droid, but if you really need it, make sure to contact the seller if it has google play installed before purchasing <br />
    <br />
    software is 8/10, -2 points for bloatware, and outdated android version (i know this doesn't matter much, but it could atleast have security updates, last security update was on july 2021)
    <h2>[hardware]</h2>
    <p>the specifications for this e-reader: snapdragon 662 (mid-range cpu from 2020), 4gb of ram, 64/128gb of storage, 3000mAh battery. <br />
    you really don't need anything better, the purpose of this device is to use it for reading or for music. <br />
    even though the lite version has no hi-fi, the speakers sound great! <br />
    <br />
    hardware is 10/10, for reading, playing music, web browsing - it does the job.
    </p>
    <h2>[verdict]</h2>
    <p>if you are looking for a phone-sized e-reader, then this is a really good option <br />
    pros: <br />
    <li>lightweight, comfortable design</li>
    <li>great battery life</li>
    <li>if the device is used for it's purpose (reading, listening to music, maybe web browsing), then the specifications are more than enough</li>
    <li>if you do plan to get the hisense touch (not the lite version), then you get a high quality dac, perfect for iem users</li>
    <li>e-readers are great productivity devices</li>
    cons: <br />
    <li>no microsd slot (i do not really care, 128gb is enough for me, but if you plan to store a lot of books, music, etc, then a microsd would be great)</li>
    <li>the back is easy to scratch because of the aluminum (you can wipe it off, but i already have a few permanent scratches)</li>
    <li>no software/security updates (this is a minor con though, but security updates would still be nice)</li>
    </p>
    overall rating: 9/10
