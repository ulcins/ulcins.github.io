    <h2>[motivation]</h2>
    <p>today i was bored, so i made a blog website :D</p>
    <p>i made this website mostly from scratch, so it is very basic, no styling or anything, and i honestly like it</p>
    <p>maybe in the future, i will improve the styling, but highly doubt, when you aren't a webdev, you don't really care and just want a basic website that works (also fast cause basic html/css)</p>
    <h2>[what's next?]</h2>
    <p>i recently got the hisense touch lite (e-reader & music player), in a few weeks, i will make a blog/review!</p>
    <p>yeah that's all, i don't expect any people to come to my website, which is fine, i just want to have a website where i can share my thoughts and etc</p>
  <p><a href="/blog.html">go back</a></p>
